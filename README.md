# Data Structures and Algos study

This repo is a compilation of studies I'm keeping for reference. Sources of exercises:

- Most exercises come from *The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S Skiena* and
- a certain Udemy course on Algo and data structures.
- There are some [codewars.com](codewars.com) exercises as well.


## Word of warning

Bear in mind the code, although not necessarily dirty, are meant for study purposes and may present
non thread safe aspects or forcibly tricks to help test and make sure they deliver the expected result.

## Format

I'll try to keep the simplified version of question statements and highly documented and commented code
for further reference. What can be annoying.
